          <p>The Jim and Bobbie Ukrop Innovation & Design Studio - or I.D. Studio - is a space in which a wide variety of students, young and young-at-heart, can come together to learn and practice a new set of skills and a different mindset.  We are especially focused on skills that enable and promote innovation through collaboration, and the mindset we aspire to is best described as a growth-mindset, focused on learning how to identify and solve big problems, and pursue great opportunities.</p><i class="fa fa-connectdevelop"></i>

          <p>The I.D. Studio is also an education laboratory; a place to experiment with new ways of learning and teaching.  We recognize the need for innovation in higher education at all levels - from undergraduate to executive training - and we welcome the challenge of learning how to be even more relevant, connected, and results-oriented in all that we do.</p>
