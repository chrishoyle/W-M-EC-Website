github repo for: <a href="http://innovate.mason.wm.edu">innovate.mason.wm.edu</a>

Installation: 
Go to your wordpress's wp-content folder (Mine is in C:\xampp\htdocs\wmec_wordpress\wp-content) and literally delete everything. Then clone this repository into that folder.

*note* 
If the navigation bar isn't there already, it needs to be created by logging into the admin panel, hovering over appearance, then clicking Menus. Then click create new menu, set the name to Navbar, and click Navigation Bar for theme location.
